# How to select your new laptop

Whether you have always deferred your laptop selection to local shop salesperson, or you're a professional developer, you may still feel like jumping into the unknown when choosing a new laptop. This article aims at sharing with you easy ways for an efficient laptop selection that will suit your needs.

First off, so that you don't feel wronged: I'm not a laptop expert and I have never worked for a laptop manufacturer. I had to purchase laptops for different purposes and different price ranges over the last 10-15 years. But I am quite thorough about benchmarking my options, so I thought I'd share what you could easily benefit from: for your budget, showing you how to select the best laptop option.

What this article is about:
- aspects to compare
- key aspects to easily get the best deal

What this is not about:
- telling you which laptop to buy right now
- advertising products or services of any kind (products shown in this article are used as examples for the selection process, I have no affiliation of any kind with any of these product manufacturers)

## How are we going to compare this
### Can't we get everything at once?


Balance between: performance, autonomy, price, weight

Perf:
- what generate perf: CPU perf + RAM, GPU + VRAM, SSD (data read/write speed, data processing speed)
- how perf is served: build quality Input (keyboard, touchpad, connectivity slots) & Output (screen, etc.)

Autonomy: how long can you expect to use it without having to plug it?
Weight: how much you'll have to carry with you
Price: 

### What are you using it for?

Your usage: gaming, Media, working, DL

Gaming: no real concern for autonomy or weight, performance is king, budget can vary
Media: autonomy, weight and screen quality are key, budget should remain low, performance is not required
Working: dev/presentations/Excel, perf important, autonomy & weight are important, budget can be high
Working in ML/DL: similar to gaming, but performance of GPU is every more important, and autonomy is nice (but rarely compatible)


### I am no expert, how can I compare tech specs?
Fortunately, people have already done the job for you. What you need: copy pasting tech description elements into your web browser

- cpu comparison: https://www.cpubenchmark.net/singleCompare.php
- gpu comparison: https://gpu.userbenchmark.com/
- expert reviewers: YouTube https://www.youtube.com/c/JarrodsTech

## Selection process


### Why not upgrade your existing laptop?



### Considering second-hand options

Backmarket

### Upgradability
RAM slots, SSD

### Hardware compatibility
Mac M1
AMD Ryzen
Non-NVIDIA

### How should you filter your search?

Goal: narrow it down to good laptops

- battery: 80Wh/86Wh
- cpu perf : intel gen
- ram : 2 slot
- gpu : power (max-q) & fps
- wifi: 11ac vs 11ax
- screen: 15' --> FHD (1080p)
- compat with ubuntu
- keyboard layout

### Where to buy it

At least compare: the manufacturer site, and your favorite tech product store website
Highly highly suggested: type your desired laptop model on search engine

WARNING: for each model, there might be different configurations. Ensure this is the same that you benchmarked (or more favorable)



## Let's take a recent example

My criteria:
- usage: Work - DL
- preferences: 15', autonomy
- budget: 1500€
- azerty layout



laptops:
- acer predator helios 300
- dell g15 5520
- lenovo legion 5i
- msi gf66



## Side tricks to avoid shortening your laptop life

### hardware 
- don't obstruct fans: laptop stand
- clean it once in a while

### software
- shut it down, dont put it to sleep
- Defrag HDD
- don't take the pre-installed tools as fixed (web browser, media player, etc.)
- upgrading sofware
