Whether you have always deferred your laptop selection to local shop salesperson, or you're a professional developer, you may still feel like a colorblind person being asked to choose the red balloon. This article aims at sharing with you **easy ways for an efficient laptop selection**.

First off, so that you don't feel wronged: I'm not a laptop expert and I have never worked for a laptop manufacturer. Nevertheless, I had to purchase laptops for different purposes and different price ranges over the last 10-15 years, and thus I became quite thorough about benchmarking my options. Since I had to recently go through this process again, I thought I'd share how you can easily benchmark and choose the best laptop for your needs without much prior knowledge.


What this article is about:
- main aspects of laptop comparison
- key aspects to easily get the best deal

What this article is not about:
- telling you which laptop to buy right now
- incentivizing products or services of any kind

{% include info.html text="Resources and products shown in this article are used as examples for the selection process, I have no affiliation of any kind with any of these product manufacturers." %}

*Along the way, you will encounter collapsable sections like so :point_down:*

## How are we going to compare this

Let's lay down a few things you should be aware of to be methodical here.

### Can't we get everything at once?

You might wonder why I don't want to share THE best laptop of the moment? Well, some of you might have guessed, but just like most consumer products, it's all a matter of balance.

Here we'll consider four main aspects: performance, autonomy, price, weight.

While the last three are self-explanatory, let's elaborate a bit on the first aspect. In this article, "performance" has two sides:
- what produces pure performance: data read/write speed, data processing speed.
- how performance is served to the user: screen, keyboard, touchpad, connectivity slots, etc.

### Processors, hard drive, RAM, what are those?

Performance-wise, the following concepts are very important as they define how you will experience your laptop (taking ages to open a single file :turtle: vs. feeling like your laptop is always waiting on you :sunglasses:).

#### Memory
storage vs RAM

HDD & SSD
RAM clockspeed

#### Processing units
CPU & GPU


#### Screen specifications
refresh rate, native resolution


### The different usage types

You can always have multiple usage for your laptop, but I highly suggest you take a second to wonder what you will actually use it for in the coming years. I'll distinguish 4 usage types and lay out how they translate in terms of comparison aspects:
- Gaming: no real concern for autonomy or weight, budget can vary, performance is key
- Media: no real performance requirement, budget should remain low, autonomy, weight and screen quality are key
- Working (software development, presentations, Excel, etc.): flexible budget constraints, performance is important, autonomy & weight are key
- Graphics intensive (deep learning, 3D rendering, etc.): similar to gaming, but performance of GPU is every more important, and autonomy is nice (but rarely compatible)

Now, bear in mind, that you can easily overlap several usage types: in my case, I have been doing deep learning for work.


### I am no expert, how can I compare tech specs?
Fortunately, people have already done the job for you. What you need: copy pasting technical description elements into your web browser

- cpu comparison: https://www.cpubenchmark.net/singleCompare.php
- gpu comparison: https://gpu.userbenchmark.com/
- expert reviewers: YouTube https://www.youtube.com/c/JarrodsTech

### Hardware incompatibility

A few notes on hardware constraints depending on your usage type:
- GPU Y/N: Gaming & deep learning usage require a dedicated GPU
- GPU NVIDIA vs. other: deep learning requires NVIDIA GPU
- software dev: avoid MAC M1
- HDD or SSD: deep learning requires SSD (if the data is not read fast enough, the GPU will have to wait / stay iddle most of the time)
- Gaming, Working & Graphics require a lot of RAM (>=8)


## Benchmark & selection process

### Before buying, why not upgrade?

If you already own a laptop, it might be worth checking if it cannot be upgraded. By upgrading, I mean changing some parts that would have a significant influence on performances.


What you can generally upgrade/replace[^1]:
- RAM: if sometimes your computer freezes temporarily, you might want to switch to a larger RAM capacity.

  Clock speed
  Dual channel

- Storage: you don't have anymore room on your laptop? You can replace it with a larger one. Transferring or reading data is really slow? You can upgrade it.

<details>
  <summary>Storage details</summary>
  
  Storage type (HDD --> SSD)
  Storage speed
</details>

- Battery: if your laptop lasts doesn't last as half as long as it used to, consider replacing the battery.

{% include info.html text="Especially for battery, it is highly recommended to replace it with one that has the same specifications! Search for your model name appended with 'battery'." %}

Whatever the type of modifications you're considering, check whether your model can be upgraded (simple web search, or Youtube search), and if the replacing components are available for sale.

What this section means is that slow data reading, insufficient storage, and dying battery are far from requiring buying a new laptop. Please don't buy a new laptop if that's the main reason, replacing a component is significantly cheaper and the planet will be quite thankful :green_heart:


### Narrow down the search scope
- screen size: 13', 15', 17'
- GPU: Y/N? AMD Radeon/NVIDIA GeForce? power (max-q) & fps
- CPU: Intel Core vs AMD Ryzen (note: generation is very important i5 12th gen >= i7 11th gen)
- RAM: capacity
- Storage: >= 512, HDD/SSD


Now given your budget, that should already narrow it down to a few laptop models.

### Look closer
- screen native resolution' --> FHD (1080p)
- battery: 80Wh/86Wh
- Keyboard layout
- wifi: 11ac vs. 11ax
- ram dual channel
- compat with Ubuntu


### Confirm your choice

Hesitating between a few options --> compare CPU/GPU
Make sure you didn't miss much: watch 2-3 review video about this model (only look out for red flags)


### Where to buy it

At least compare: the manufacturer site, and your favorite tech product store website
Highly highly suggested: type your desired laptop model on search engine
Second hand: backmarket

{% include alert.html text="For each laptop model, there might be multiple manufacturer configurations. Ensure that your selection is the same as the one you just benchmarked (or at least as favorable), including the keyboard layout." %}




## Let's take a recent example

My criteria:
- usage: Work - DL
- preferences: 15', autonomy
- budget: 1500€
- azerty layout

-->
- screen size: 15'
- GPU: NVIDIA GeForce, RTX 30
- CPU: Intel Core 12th gen (>= i5) or 11th gen(>= i7)
- RAM: >=16Gb
- Storage: >= 512, SSD


laptops:
- acer predator helios 300
- dell g15 5520
- lenovo legion 5i
- msi gf66


close:
- screen native resolution' --> FHD (1080p)
- battery: 80Wh/86Wh
- Keyboard layout: azerty
- wifi: 11ac vs. 11ax
- ram dual channel
- compat with Ubuntu



## Side tricks to avoid shortening your laptop life

### hardware 
- don't obstruct fans: laptop stand
- clean it once in a while

### software
- shut it down, dont put it to sleep
- Defrag HDD
- don't take the pre-installed tools as fixed (web browser, media player, etc.)
- upgrading sofware
