First off, so that you don't feel wronged: I'm not a laptop expert and I have never worked for a laptop manufacturer. Nevertheless, I had to purchase laptops for different purposes and different price ranges over the last 10-15 years, and thus I became quite thorough about benchmarking my options. Since I had to recently go through this process again, I thought I'd share how you can easily benchmark and choose the best laptop for your needs without much prior knowledge.


What this article is about:
- main aspects of laptop comparison
- key aspects to easily get the best deal

What this article is not about:
- telling you which laptop to buy right now
- incentivizing products or services of any kind

{% include info.html text="Resources and products shown in this article are used as examples for the selection process, I have no affiliation of any kind with any of these product manufacturers." %}

*Along the way, you will encounter collapsable sections like so :point_down:*

## How are we going to compare this

Let's lay down a few things you should be aware of to be methodical here.

### Can't we get everything at once?

You might wonder why I don't want to share THE best laptop of the moment? Well, some of you might have guessed, but just like most consumer products, it's all a matter of balance.

Here we'll consider four main aspects: performance, autonomy, price, weight.

While the last three are self-explanatory, let's elaborate a bit on the first aspect. In this article, "performance" has two sides:
- what produces pure performance: data read/write speed, data processing speed.
- how performance is served to the user: screen, keyboard, touchpad, connectivity slots, etc.

### Processors, hard drive, RAM, what are those?

Performance-wise, the following concepts are very important as they define how you will experience your laptop (taking ages to open a single file :turtle: vs. feeling like your laptop is always waiting on you :sunglasses:).

#### Memory

For computers, memory is a bit too broad of a term: we distinguish storage (things that remains saved even after shutting down your laptop) from RAM (information currently being used by your computer to perform a task at a given moment).

{% include info.html text="RAM stands for Random Access Memory, which isn't very explicit. The French name is more self-explanatory 'mémoire vive' which translates to 'quick/vivacious memory'." %}

##### Storage

To put this into perspective, when using your file explorer, the files that you see are located on your storage device. The information is written in this device so that when powered off, the data prevails. The parallel with human memory would be that storage is where you keep the memory of your first holiday abroad without thinking actively about it. They can be used as external storage devices, and internal ones. Here we focus on the latter[^1], because that's what comes with your laptop.

To compare storage options, consider their storage capacity (measured in Gigabytes/Gb or Gigaoctets/Go) and their read/write speed. To avoid getting a bit too technical, among the two main storage types, HDD (Hard Disk Drive) and SSD (Solid State Drive), SSDs are considerably faster but more expensive.

<details>
  <summary>HDD vs. SSD</summary>

  ![hdd-versus-ssd](https://microage.ca/quebec/wp-content/uploads/sites/56/bb-plugin/cache/hard-drive-ssd-1-landscape.jpg)

  HDD are spinning disks, similar to vinyl record/CD, with two layers: a ferromagnetic layer, where data is stored, and a protective layer. The data interactions are performed by a read/write head (actuator arm), by leveraging the relation between electric current and local magnetic field. They were [introduced by IBM in 1956](https://www.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/storage/storage_350.html).

  For SSDs, forget the spinning disk, each byte of information is written on [MOS transistors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOSFET). Thanks to the general trend of transistor density in manufacturing (cf. [Moore law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law)), we can now fit quite a lot of those on an integrated circuit. It was first [brought to market by SanDisk in 1991](https://www.computerhistory.org/storageengine/solid-state-drive-module-demonstrated/).
</details>

##### RAM

RAM could be seen as the maximum immediate capacity to remember information (phone number, etc.). On a computer, you sollicitate the RAM as open more web browser tabs, or applications for instance. In terms of speed, SSDs can't even compete with RAM, but RAM is much more limited in terms of capacity (as of 2022, usually a few Gb or dozens of Gb, while storage capacity is roughly two orders of magnitude larger).

<details>
  <summary>RAM frequency</summary>

  Clock cycles: 4800MHz -> 4.8 billion cycles per second

  Column Access Strobe Latency (CL): number of clock cycles it takes for the RAM to respond to a command

  SDR vs. DDR
  ![sdr-ddr](https://www.cgdirector.com/wp-content/uploads/media/2022/03/SDR-vs-DDR-1536x810.jpg)

  DDR generation: DDR4 (1600-3600 MHz) DDR5 (3200-6400 MHz)

  Dual-channel: when your CPU needs to hold data, but your RAM capacity is reached or the RAM speed isn't enough, it will start to use your storage device for this, which is much slower. Enters dual-channel memory to increase the transfer rate between the computer's memory and the CPU. Instead of having a single channel 8Gb RAM connected to your motherboard & thus CPU, having 2 4Gb RAM sticks will have the same RAM capacity as before but double the maximum speed.

### The different usage types

You can always have multiple usage for your laptop, but I highly suggest you take a second to wonder what you will actually use it for in the coming years. I'll distinguish 4 usage types and lay out how they translate in terms of comparison aspects:
- Gaming: no real concern for autonomy or weight, budget can vary, performance is key
- Media: no real performance requirement, budget should remain low, autonomy, weight and screen quality are key
- Working (software development, presentations, Excel, etc.): flexible budget constraints, performance is important, autonomy & weight are key
- Graphics intensive (deep learning, 3D rendering, etc.): similar to gaming, but performance of GPU is every more important, and autonomy is nice (but rarely compatible)

Now, bear in mind, that you can easily overlap several usage types: in my case, I have been doing deep learning for work.


### I am no expert, how can I compare tech specs?
Fortunately, people have already done the job for you. What you need: copy pasting technical description elements into your web browser

- cpu comparison: https://www.cpubenchmark.net/singleCompare.php
- gpu comparison: https://gpu.userbenchmark.com/
- expert reviewers: YouTube https://www.youtube.com/c/JarrodsTech

### Hardware incompatibility

A few notes on hardware constraints depending on your usage type:
- GPU Y/N: Gaming & deep learning usage require a dedicated GPU
- GPU NVIDIA vs. other: deep learning requires NVIDIA GPU
- software dev: avoid MAC M1
- HDD or SSD: deep learning requires SSD (if the data is not read fast enough, the GPU will have to wait / stay iddle most of the time)
- Gaming, Working & Graphics require a lot of RAM (>=8)


## Benchmark & selection process

### Before buying, why not upgrade?

If you already own a laptop, it might be worth checking if it cannot be upgraded. By upgrading, I mean changing some parts that would have a significant influence on performances.


What you can generally upgrade/replace[^2]:
- RAM: if sometimes your computer freezes temporarily, you might want to switch to a larger RAM capacity.

  Dual channel

- Storage: you don't have anymore room on your laptop? You can replace it with a larger one. Transferring or reading data is really slow? You can upgrade it.

  <summary>Storage details</summary>
  
  Storage type (HDD --> SSD)

</details>

- Battery: if your laptop lasts doesn't last as half as long as it used to, consider replacing the battery.

{% include info.html text="Especially for battery, it is highly recommended to replace it with one that has the same specifications! Search for your model name appended with 'battery'." %}

Whatever the type of modifications you're considering, check whether your model can be upgraded (simple web search, or Youtube search), and if the replacing components are available for sale.

What this section means is that slow data reading, insufficient storage, and dying battery are far from requiring buying a new laptop. Please don't buy a new laptop if that's the main reason, replacing a component is significantly cheaper and the planet will be quite thankful :green_heart:


### Narrow down the search scope
- screen size: 13', 15', 17'
- GPU: Y/N? AMD Radeon/NVIDIA GeForce? power (max-q) & fps
- CPU: Intel Core vs AMD Ryzen (note: generation is very important i5 12th gen >= i7 11th gen)
- RAM: capacity
- Storage: >= 512, HDD/SSD

<details>
  <summary>Integrated vs dedicated graphics</summary>
  
  Modern laptops always have a GPU, but we focus on dedicated GPUs here, which are much more powerful. You can easily recognize this with the brand: NVIDIA (GeForce products) and AMD (Radeon products) are the market leaders on dedicated GPUs, if it's from another brand (like Intel), it's most likely an integrated GPU. Confirm your hunch with a web search :wink:
</details>

Now given your budget, that should already narrow it down to a few laptop models.

### Look closer
- screen native resolution' --> FHD (1080p)
- battery: 80Wh/86Wh
- Keyboard layout
- wifi: 11ac vs. 11ax
- ram dual channel
- compat with Ubuntu


### Confirm your choice

Hesitating between a few options --> compare CPU/GPU
Make sure you didn't miss much: watch 2-3 review video about this model (only look out for red flags)


### Where to buy it

At least compare: the manufacturer site, and your favorite tech product store website
Highly highly suggested: type your desired laptop model on search engine
Second hand: backmarket

{% include alert.html text="For each laptop model, there might be multiple manufacturer configurations. Ensure that your selection is the same as the one you just benchmarked (or at least as favorable), including the keyboard layout." %}




## A concrete example

My criteria
| Column 1 | Column 2 |
|-|-|
| Usage | Working & Graphics intensive [^3] |
| Sreen size | 15' |
| Sreen resolution | 1080p [^4] |
| Autonomy | >= 3-4h when not using the GPU |
| Budget | <= 1500€ |
| Kayboard layout | Azerty |


--> Working & DL usage
- GPU: NVIDIA GeForce, RTX 20 or 30
- CPU: Intel Core 12th gen (>= i5) or 11th gen(>= i7) OR AMD Ryzen 6k series (>=5) or 5k series(>= 7)
- RAM: >=16Gb
- Storage: >= 512, SSD


laptops:
- acer predator helios 300
- dell g15 5520
- lenovo legion 5i
- msi gf66


closer:
- screen native resolution' --> FHD (1080p)
- battery: 80Wh/86Wh
- Keyboard layout: azerty
- wifi: 11ac vs. 11ax
- ram dual channel
- compat with Ubuntu

<details>
  <summary>MUX Switch</summary>
  
  So this is a concept I discovered while benchmarking a few weeks back but quite an interesting one, especially if you're using your laptop for Gaming!

  With a MUX Switch: data processed on dGPU, then directly displayed on screen
  Without: data processed on dGPU, then processed by iGPU, then displayed on screen

  What does that change: having MUX switch lets you choose, but when it's on, you get better FPS in games, at the cost of high power/battery consumption.

## Side tricks to avoid shortening your laptop life

### hardware 
- don't obstruct fans: laptop stand
- clean it once in a while

### software
- shut it down, dont put it to sleep
- Defrag HDD
- don't take the pre-installed tools as fixed (web browser, media player, etc.)
- upgrading sofware

[^1]:both serve the same function. But external drives are usually used for backups and extra file storage, while internal ones, on top of static files, also hold your operating system files (e.g. Windows, MAC, Ubuntu, etc.).
[^2]:some manufacturers, like Apple, don't let people easily tweak the interior or their laptops.
[^3]:I would be using it for Deep Learning more specifically.
[^4]:corresponds to 1920 by 1080 pixels, also called FHD (Full High Definition).
