Whether you have always deferred your laptop selection to local shop salesperson, or you’re a professional developer, you may still feel like jumping into the unknown when choosing a new laptop. This article aims at sharing with you easy ways for an efficient laptop selection that will suit your needs. . . First off, so that you don’t feel wronged: I’m not a laptop expert and I have never worked for a laptop manufacturer. I had to purchase laptops for different purposes and different price ranges over the last 10-15 years. But I am quite thorough about benchmarking my options, so I thought I’d share what you could easily benefit from: for your budget, showing you how to select the best laptop option. . . You can include alert boxes . You can include info boxes What this article is about: . aspects to compare | key aspects to easily get the best deal | . What this is not about: . telling you which laptop to buy right now | advertising products or services of any kind (products shown in this article are used as examples for the selection process, I have no affiliation of any kind with any of these product manufacturers) | . How are we going to compare this . Can’t we get everything at once? . Balance between: performance, autonomy, price, weight . Perf: . what generate perf: CPU perf + RAM, GPU + VRAM, SSD (data read/write speed, data processing speed) | how perf is served: build quality Input (keyboard, touchpad, connectivity slots) &amp; Output (screen, etc.) | . Autonomy: how long can you expect to use it without having to plug it? Weight: how much you’ll have to carry with you Price: . What are you using it for? . Your usage: gaming, Media, working, DL . Gaming: no real concern for autonomy or weight, performance is king, budget can vary Media: autonomy, weight and screen quality are key, budget should remain low, performance is not required Working: dev/presentations/Excel, perf important, autonomy &amp; weight are important, budget can be high Working in ML/DL: similar to gaming, but performance of GPU is every more important, and autonomy is nice (but rarely compatible) . I am no expert, how can I compare tech specs? . Fortunately, people have already done the job for you. What you need: copy pasting tech description elements into your web browser . cpu comparison: https://www.cpubenchmark.net/singleCompare.php | gpu comparison: https://gpu.userbenchmark.com/ | expert reviewers: YouTube https://www.youtube.com/c/JarrodsTech | . Selection process . Why not upgrade your existing laptop? . Considering second-hand options . Backmarket . Upgradability . RAM slots, SSD . Hardware compatibility . Mac M1 AMD Ryzen Non-NVIDIA . How should you filter your search? .

Where to buy it . At least compare: the manufacturer site, and your favorite tech product store website Highly highly suggested: type your desired laptop model on search engine . WARNING: for each model, there might be different configurations. Ensure this is the same that you benchmarked (or more favorable) . Let’s take a recent example . My criteria: . usage: Work - DL | preferences: 15’, autonomy | budget: 1500€ | azerty layout | . laptops: . acer predator helios 300 | dell g15 5520 | lenovo legion 5i | msi gf66 | . Side tricks to avoid shortening your laptop life . hardware . don’t obstruct fans: laptop stand | clean it once in a while | . software . shut it down, dont put it to sleep | Defrag HDD | don’t take the pre-installed tools as fixed (web browser, media player, etc.) | upgrading sofware | .
