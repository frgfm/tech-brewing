Hello there :wave:

I'm FG (short for Fran√ßois-Guillaume :fr:)

My background revolves around computer science & engineering, and I have been working in early stage startups for the last 5 years! Those positions have gradually gotten me to specialize in Deep Learning and develop a taste for open source projects. 

I do believe that posting about a topic forces me to sharpen my knowledge and document my progression, which sounds like a decent win :grin:

What you can expect me to write about in this blog [^1]:
- computer science & mathematics (deep learning mostly)
- physics
- resource efficiency
- music
- photography
- entrepreneurship

Enjoy the tour!
